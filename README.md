## List of Dependencies<a name="dependency"></a>
The `requirements file` list all the libraries/dependencies required to run the notebooks/projects in this repository.

## Instructions to use the repository<a name="instructions"></a>
1. Clone this github repository and start using it.
`git clone https://github.com/Ankit-Kumar-Saini/Applications-of-Data-Science`


## File Descriptions<a name="desc"></a>
1. The `Sentiment Analysis folder` contains code to deploy a web app for movie review sentiment analysis. The following files/folders are present inside
	1. app folder: It contains the main python script `app.py` to run the web app, templates to render the web app and a `SQL database` to store the user inputs.
	2. models folder: It contains the tokenizer and weights of the model. These are loaded to run the model for making predictions on user input during inference.
	3. sentiment analysis.ipynb: This jupyter notebook contains the code to train the model using bag of words approach on movie reviews. It also has the code to `train Word Embeddings` from scratch.

2. Basics of SQL.ipynb: This jupyter notebook demonstrates the use of basic SQL commands on a toy dataset.

3. Transfer Learning.ipynb: This notebook contains code to classify images of Cat, Kanye West and Pickachu using pre-trained EfficientNetB0 model.

4. Web Scrapping.ipynb: This notebook demonstrates the use of `Beautiful Soup` library for web scrapping with an example.

5. Visualization data: This folder contains data for creating visualizations in `matplotlib`.

6. dog_cat: This is a dummy database file created to demonstrate the use of basic SQL queries.
